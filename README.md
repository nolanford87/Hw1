### C

- The elevator call buttons are missing directional arrows which are not super important but still help, even though intuitively the user assumes the upper arrow is to go up, and the lower arrow is to go down.

- the interface is cluttered becuase of the use of labels off to the side of the button instead of incorperating labels in the buttons. Even with braille considered, a audio response of floor 3 would be a better system.

### B

- Commonly elevators are used to assist people in reaching higher floors of a building. Whether this means with a burden, or simply because it is easier than taking the stairs. Elevators also enable the disabled to reach higher floors.

- The interface has tactile buttons that are easy to press if you arms are full. The interface also has braille to assist the blind. Although the light on the button does not assist the blind in confiriming which floor they selected.

- Commonly people call the elevator from the outside deciding whether they want to go up or down. Then they select the floor they wish to reach on the inside by pressing the corresponding button on the panel.

- The Elevator has labels to the side of the button to let users know which button corresponds to what function. The labels have fairly intuitive images.

- The Elevator provides feedback to the user by lighting up the button that is selected. the elevator also dings once it reaches a floor.

- With the current design people could potentially press the label instead of the button. Also due to the clutter they could press an unintended button and end up on the wrong floor. Due to the elevator only dinging, people could get off on the wrong floor since the elevator does not indicate audibly "Floor two."
